# Design logic (UX)

## Home

A list of the different themes that the user can pick (name: the unwritten rule book)

Once the user chooses a theme, they will be brought to page 2:
The second page is made out of 2 sections:
A story mode (where the levels are layed out in the path of a story (see slide 8, mode primaire)
A "dump" mode (where all the levels a layed out alphabetically so that the user can chose as they please)

## The parents

This section is composed (for the moment) of sections:
Section 1: guide du parcours du patient (see quote from Aur√©lie de saint thibault, slide: 6)
Section 2: billing (this is where the user can manage their subscription and update their details)

## The about

This is the page where we talk about:

* us
* Why we created this website
*

## The pricing

This is where we explain the price
The reason for it
The different billing methods
The different plans (if present)

## On another note

* Where would the logout button be for a logged in user
* Where would the login button be
* Where would the register button be (if not with the login)
* Where would the user settings be
* Where would the appearance (dark/light, font family, font size, daltonian filters) be located
* Do we need a footer on the page, what would be in it?
