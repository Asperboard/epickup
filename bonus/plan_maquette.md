# Design logic (UX)

## Home

A list of the different themes that the user can pick (name: the unwritten rule book)

Once the user chooses a theme, they will be brought to page 2:
The second page is made out of 2 sections:
A story mode (where the levels are layed out in the path of a story (see slide 8, mode primaire)
A "dump" mode (where all the levels a layed out alphabetically so that the user can chose as they please)

## The parents

This section is composed (for the moment) of sections:
Section 1: guide du parcours du patient (see quote from Aur√©lie de saint Thibault, slide: 6)
Section 2: billing (this is where the user can manage their subscription and update their details)

## The about

This is the page where we talk about:

* us : 
* What is the Asperger syndrom ?

    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):
    A set of neurobiological disorders that affect the development of individuals referred to as "autistic."

    Autism:
    Disorders affecting communication, obsessive interests or activities, repetitive behaviors, and a strong resistance to change.

* Why did we create Asperboard ?

    As a parent of a person with an ASD, it is difficult to find resources to address the challenges related to autism for several reasons:

    * Geographical inequalities: Large cities have more specialized facilities, whereas rural areas are often underserved.
    * Shortage of trained professionals: The number of doctors, psychologists, and speech therapists specializing in autism remains insufficient to meet demand.
    * Difficulty accessing care and support: Even after a diagnosis, families struggle to find places in specialized facilities (CAMSP, SESSAD, IME, etc.), and private care is often expensive.

Legal point :
* RGPD
* confidentiality policy
* consent policy

## On another note

* Where would the logout button be for a logged in user
* Where would the login button be
* Where would the register button be (if not with the login)
* Where would the user settings be
* Where would the appearance (dark/light, font family, font size, daltonian filters) be located
* Do we need a footer on the page, what would be in it?
